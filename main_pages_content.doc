Remote exams are open and hard
You can use the Internet, WhatsApp, ChatGPT, your notes, your friends, your pets…
The RoE is especially hard. Read: What is the purpose of an impossible RoE exam?
Final exam is in-person and closed book. It tests your memory. It’s easy.
Projects test application. The projects test how well you apply what you learnt in a real-world context.
Bonus activities may be posted on Discourse. See previous bonus activities
